            All cats are beautiful, but orange tabby cats are known for their colorful coats and unique pattern. The term tabby refers to the combination of stripes, spots, and swirls which cover the cat’s body.

Depending on the breed of cat and its individual genetics, the tabby pattern can be localized to patches or certain body parts, or it could cover the entire body of the cat.

The tabby pattern comes in five different varieties: Mackerel, Classic, Spotted, Ticked, Patched. Though each orange tabby is different, tabbies in general have specific characteristics that are easily identified. These include: An M-shaped marking on the forehead, white or dark lining around the eyes, pigment on the paws and lips, thin “pencil” lines on the face, pale color on the chin and belly and banding on the legs and tail
